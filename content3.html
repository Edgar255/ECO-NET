        <h1>Plastic</h1>
        <p>Recycling plastics can be confusing. There are seven categories of plastic with a wide range of colors and shapes. Each one is unique and serves a particular purpose. And depending on their chemical composition, certain forms of plastic are reusable, and others are not. Some can be recycled, and others must be disposed of differently. It can get very complicated since each local recycling facility collects different types of plastic, and not all plastics are collected.</p><br>
        <p>You'll find that the seven categories of plastic are sometimes marked with little numbers inside triangles. These symbols are part of the Resin Identification Coding System which was developed solely to identify the plastic resin used in a manufactured product, but not their recyclability. This coding system was initially created in 1988 by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. (SPI) and is now managed by ASTM International. As you look for these symbols, you may notice that only some plastic items are clearly labeled. This is because the recycling code system is a voluntary industry system and not federal law.</p><br>
        <p>Here we provide an overview and quick guide to help you sort your plastic and understand what each of these symbols means. We've also provided some resources that may aid in your quest to recycle your items. Remember that your plastic material is not necessarily recyclable just because it has a recycling symbol. Always check with your local recycling program to confirm what is accepted.</p><br>
        <h1>RECYCLING RESOURCES</h1>
        <p>If your local municipality can't recycle your item, Terracycle can help. Terracycle offers free recycling programs for hard-to-recycle items. Terracycle partners with brands, manufacturers, and retailers that cover the cost of shipping their products and packaging for recycling. You can send in the objects accepted for each program you join. The web page for the program will detail precisely what you can send to TerraCycle to be recycled through that program. For instance, one brand may only sponsor a program to recycle its own products and packaging. Another program will accept products and packaging from other brands as well. To get started, create an account with Terracycle and join as many programs as you like. Collect your stuff and print a prepaid shipping label to send your box of collected products and packaging to be sent back for recycling. Some programs have limited spots, so you may be placed on a waitlist if a program is full. Not to worry, Terracycle also has public collection locations or drop-off points where items are collected to be sent back to TerraCycle for recycling. You can read about the drop-off programs here. The way these collection sites work is simple. Deliver the products that are acceptable to a drop-off location nearby. No shipping or accounts are necessary. The volunteer administrator of the public drop-off point will send the recycling to TerraCycle using a prepaid label. For materials that aren't accepted locally or through the free recycling services, you can purchase a Zero Waste Box from Terracycle. Zero Waste Boxes are great because everything can be recycled!</p><br>
        <p>Another valuable recycling resource is the Earth911 website, which you can use to access its Recycling Locator. Type in your zip code and search your item using the search box or use the quick search suggestions in the lefthand column to find out how and where to recycle your stuff.</p><br>
        <h1>RESPONSIBLE RECYCLING</h1>
        <p>Often the burden of responsibility for the post-consumer management of products has fallen on local governments, with recycling programs run and financed by taxpayer dollars. But the cost of managing and recycling these materials is rising, and local governments have no control over how products are created or how simple they are to recycle. Manufacturers have the most immediate control over a product's design and production and whether it can be recycled or not. These producers should absolutely bear more responsibility for making their products recyclable. But too much contamination from soiled materials and non-recyclables is one of the reasons manufacturers commonly reject tons of processed recyclables every year. So make sure your items are clean and dry before tossing them in the recycle bin. If you find your object can't be donated or reused and isn't clearly listed as recyclable, it's best to put it in the trash. Tossing your item in the recycling bin to try to give it a second life only risks contaminating and spoiling a batch of perfectly good recyclables or breaking recycling machinery. Remember, avoiding plastic beats recycling it. You can always make different choices about what you purchase in the future. Making even small recycling changes can make a huge difference!</p>
